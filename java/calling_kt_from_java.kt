/*
When Kotlin was developed,
it worked solely on JVM, hence it provides a
 complete set of features that makes calling
  Kotlin from Java, quite easy.
 For example, objects of Kotlin classes can be
  easily created and their methods can be invoked
   in Java methods. However,
  there are some rules about how Kotlin code can
   be used in Java.
